# Pokemon (suspended)
One of the holiday projects aimed at recreating the popular game called "Pokemon".
The main goal of the project was to broaden the knowledge about object-oriented programming and an attempt to implement most of the mechanics from the "LeafGreen" series.

The game currently offers:
- one map (Pallet town) -- in the development phase,
- nine items (Balls, Potions and Map),
- four pokemons (Charmander, Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Pidgey),
- nine attacks (basic attacks of the mentioned pokemons),
- most of the available player menu (including the pokemon menu),
- pokemon combat,
- catching creatures,
- and a few smaller mechanics.

Mechanics and patterns were implemented thanks to the website:<br />

Patterns and visual elements were downloaded from the website: <br />
https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/pokemonfireredleafgreen/ and prepared in the *Piskel* program. <br />
Sound effects come from the sites:<br />
